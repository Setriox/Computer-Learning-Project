Jonobr Physics:
    Based on Traer Physics Libary, some library I've never heard or seen before. It uses Java, my old good 'ol
    programming language that I used to love. Maybe this javascript port will be easier to understand?


Box2d-js:
    Used it before. Liked it. Used by boxcar2d. I dunno, lemme try it out.
